<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, I’m a creative turned web developer with a passion for building clean, responsive, and purposeful websites. <br/>
  My journey began in content creation and educational program design, where I learned how to communicate clearly and design for real people. <br/>
  Now, I’m applying that mindset to code.

I’m currently sharpening my skills in:
<ul>
<li>Frontend: HTML, CSS (Flexbox, Grid, Bootstrap), JavaScript, React.js</li>

<li>Backend: Node.js, Express.js, EJS</li>

<li>Database & Tools: SQL, PostgreSQL, Git, GitHub, version control</li>

<li>Exploring NFTs and how blockchain integrates with web experiences.</li></ul>

</p>

<p>I’m transitioning into web development, blending a background in content creation, education program design, 
  and Christian-themed storytelling. 
  <br>I’ve led impactful projects—from youth learning events to social media campaigns—and 
  I’m now expanding my skill set to build meaningful digital experiences. <br>
  Passionate about growth and community, 
  I’m driven to create tools and platforms that inform, inspire, and connect.<br>
I’m excited to build projects that connect, educate, and inspire. Let’s create something meaningful.</p>
